# Tetris Trainer

An NES tetris clone, modified to allow for effective build practice. Input custom piece sets and board states, and save/load state to practice tough builds!

Coded by Gregory Cannon and Christian Harris, originally based off a Javascript Tetris engine from Code Explained, although heavily modified and extended.
