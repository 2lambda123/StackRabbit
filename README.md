# Tetris Trainer

An NES tetris clone, modified to allow for effective build practice. Input custom piece sets and board states, and save/load state to practice tough builds!

Coded by Gregory Cannon and Christian Harris, originally based off the engine from Code Explained (https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/Tetris-JavaScript) although heavily modified and extended.
