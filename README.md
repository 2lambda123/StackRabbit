# Tetris Trainer

An NES tetris clone, modified to allow for effective build practice. Input custom piece sets and board states, and save/load state to practice tough builds!

Coded by Gregory Cannon in 2019, based off the engine from Code Explained. Modified to be more NES-like and to have the additional training features. Check out the original here:  https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/Tetris-JavaScript.
