# Tetris Trainer

An NES tetris clone, modified to allow for effective practice. Features:

- Frame perfect recreation of DAS, rotation, scoring, levels, etc.
- Draw or paste in a custom board and try playing out that situation
- Try out killscreen play at 50% or 33% speed (with adjusted DAS speed to mimic a realistic tap range!)
- Use Dig Practice and Drought Practice mode to practice tough sequences
- Enter a custom piece sequence to experiment with openers
- Use custom DAS settings to emulate your own hypertapping speed (without worrying about losing DAS!)
- Practice 19+ play at a slow speed to improve stacking

Coded by Gregory Cannon with help from Christian Harris. Originally based off a Javascript Tetris engine from Code Explained, although now modified to the point of unrecognizability.
